# Hybrid-Branch-predictor

This project was completed as a part of the curriculum. The aim of this project was to design a more efficient version of the branch predictor and further reduce the misprediction rate of the predictor.

In simple words, the hybrid predictor utilizes the benefits of each of the gshare and bimodal predictor to further reduce the overall misprediction rate.
